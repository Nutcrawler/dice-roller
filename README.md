# Dice::Roller - dice-roller module for Perl 6

Dice::Roller is the second of my forays into learning Perl 6. The aim is simple - take a "dice string" representing a series of RPG-style dice to be rolled, plus any modifiers, parse it, and get Perl 6 to virtually roll the dice involved and report the total.
